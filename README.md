# 2023-ts-stack

Hi, i'm Hugo and this is my 2023 stack showcase.

This is built as a [Lerna Monorepo](https://lerna.js.org/docs/getting-started) to leverage code reusability and project isolation. I use [NX](https://lerna.js.org/docs/lerna-and-nx) as task runner.

Node version was fixed to v18.2.x using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc).
